Your task is to extract a list of core educational prerequisite concepts that are **explicitly mentioned** in the provided prerequisites description. 
These should reflect the key theoretical foundations that are essential to understanding the course material.

These concepts must be general or structured enough to appear in academic curricula, Wikidata, or educational taxonomies.

## Guidelines:

- **Only extract concepts that are directly and clearly mentioned in the course content.**
  - Do not infer or deduce concepts based on implication or context.
  - If a concept is not explicitly stated in the course content, do not include it.
- Normalize extracted terms to canonical academic phrasing.
  - Example: "LLM" → "large language model"
  - Example: "attributive grammar" → "attribute grammar"
- If the course content includes non-standard, colloquial, or incorrect terms, correct them to the nearest canonical concept.
  - Example: "dynamic array" → "dynamic list"
  - Example: "regex" → "regular expression"
- If a term requires disambiguation, include a qualifier (e.g., "grammar (linguistics)", "translator (computer science)").
- Always use the **singular form** (e.g., "finite automaton", not "finite automata").

### Exclude:
- Overly broad umbrella areas (e.g., "robotics", "mathematics", "computer science") unless formalized as a concept.
- Specific named instances or examples within a broader concept (e.g., exclude "singleton pattern", but include "design pattern").

## Output format:
Return a **semicolon-separated list** of canonical educational concepts only. Do not include any explanations or commentary.
If there are no prerequisites output "NONE".

## Examples
### Example 1:

Prerequisite section for the course "Linear Algebra and Analytic Geometry":
"Knowledge of basic information about geometric figures and elementary functions, as well as polynomials and their roots. Basic information about complex numbers."

Output: 
geometric figure; elementary functions; polynomials, polynomial roots, complex numbers

### Example 2:

Prerequisite section for the course "Copyright and Patent Law":
"No prerequisites."

Output: 
NONE

## Your example to analyze:
Prerequisite section for the course "<course_name>": 
"""
<description>

Output:
