Your task is to extract a list of core educational concepts that are taught in the provided course. 
These should reflect the key theoretical foundations that are essential to understand the course content.

These concepts should bee general or structured enough to appear in academic curricula, Wikidata, or educational taxonomies.

## Guidelines:

- Extract only meaningful educational concepts: **theories, frameworks, models, algorithms, methods, formal systems, programming languages**, or structured academic topics.
- Use **canonical academic phrasing**, normalized to standard terms.
  - Example: "LLM" → "large language model"
  - Example: "attributive grammar" → "attribute grammar"
- If a term requires disambiguation, include a **qualifier** (e.g., "translator (computer science)").
- Always use **singular form** for concepts (e.g., "finite automaton", not "finite automata").
- Exclude:
  - Overly broad umbrella areas (e.g., "robotics", "mathematics", "computer science") unless formalized.
  - Specific named examples within already mentioned concept (e.g., exclude "singleton pattern", but include "design pattern").

## Output format:
Return a **semicolon-separated list** of canonical educational concepts only. Do not include any explanations or commentary.
